Hi! I'm Pratik, a full stack developer currently working on a project called "Realtime Chat Application," similar to WhatsApp. I'll be sharing the timeline of my progress on this project. Let's get started!

Day 0: Project Inception
After mastering the MERN stack and exploring various project ideas, I decided to develop a "Realtime Chat Application" similar to WhatsApp. I researched additional technologies such as Socket.io and Shadecn to enhance the application. After several days of planning, I created a rough structure for the app, outlining the division of components and their development sequence.

Day 1 (31-07-2024): Initial Setup
Set up the project using Vite with React, and configured TailwindCSS.
Established basic routing with react-router-dom, creating pages for authentication, chat, and profile.
Focused on the dynamic login/signup frontend page, iterating through several designs until it felt right.

Days 2 & 3 (1 & 2-08-2024): Server-Side Development
Began server-side coding, installing necessary packages: express, dotenv, cors, cookie-parser, mongoose, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken.
In index.js, connected to MongoDB and set up middleware.
Created folders for middleware, controllers, and models:
Built the UserModel.
Implemented signup and login logic in authControllers.
Set up routing in authRoutes.
Faced significant challenges while handling client-side requests:
Successfully implemented signup functionality but encountered persistent 404 errors during login.
After extensive debugging, resolved the issue by refining the Axios POST request URLs.
Integrated zustand for state management to handle user data across the app.
Designed the profile page UI, undergoing several iterations before finalizing the design.

Days 4 & 5 (3 & 4-08-2024): Exam Break
Focused on exams, while planning the next steps for the project.
